Prison Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling  in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a prison management app so that we can manage prisoner population. 

MVP: 

The user must be able to add cells, add / remove prisoners, feed prisoners and anything else you can dream up!

Project Extensions:
 
* Prisoners marked as violent cannot be placed in the same cell if they would harm one and another. 
* Prisoners can be transferred to other prisons :/
* Visitors can enter / exit the prison if the prisoner they are visiting is not in solitary confinement. 
* View the number of visitors in the prison at a given time.
* Prisoners can randomly riot and break out of their cells.
